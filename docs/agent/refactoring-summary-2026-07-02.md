# Grasp Rat Bot - Strategy Refactoring Summary

## Phase Notes: Strategy Module Extraction and First Integration

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Commit**: `4fcd904` - "Refactor: Extract strategy modules for improved maintainability"

## What Was Done

### Created 8 New Strategy Modules (1,686 lines)

1. **action-priority.js** (105 lines)
   - Priority band hierarchy: exit → safety → combat → profit → recover → wait
   - Action classification and target key extraction

2. **action-arbitration.js** (156 lines)
   - Prevents rapid target oscillation with 480ms hold window
   - Smart priority-based action holding with history tracking

3. **combat-constants.js** (120 lines)
   - Centralized 30+ combat configuration values
   - Range, HP, stamina, fire discipline, and aim parameters
   - Self-validation functions

4. **combat-target-selection.js** (214 lines)
   - Target eligibility filtering (invulnerability, whitelist)
   - Priority scoring (distance, bullets, HP, Drop)
   - Proactive Active combat gates (Drop ≥5, stamina budget)

5. **combat-movement.js** (242 lines)
   - Dynamic combat spacing (4.5-6.5m)
   - 8-direction threat field dodge calculation
   - Movement modifier composition (dodge/back-away/close-in)

6. **combat-fire-discipline.js** (220 lines)
   - 7-state fire state machine (disabled → paused → probe → normal → finish → pressure)
   - Stamina reserve-based shooting gates
   - Retreating edge and low-confidence throttling

7. **opportunity-constants.js** (134 lines)
   - Coin routing and profit system configuration
   - ROI calculation helpers (movement: 1ms/cm, shot: 500ms)
   - Switch margin and hysteresis logic

8. **self-test.js** (183 lines)
   - 13 automated test cases covering all modules
   - **All tests passing** ✓

### Documentation

- **docs/refactoring-notes-2026-07-02.md** - Detailed refactoring rationale and results
- **src/strategy/README.md** - Complete module architecture guide with usage examples

## Validation Results

✅ **Strategy module self-tests**: 13/13 passed  
✅ **Main file self-tests**: 310 cases passed  
✅ **Syntax validation**: Clean  
✅ **Combat log service tests**: Passed  
✅ **Git push**: Success

## Key Benefits

### 1. Maintainability
- Constants centralized in single locations
- Related functions grouped by concern
- Clear module boundaries and responsibilities

### 2. Testability
- Modules testable in isolation
- Clear input/output contracts
- Self-validation functions built-in

### 3. Code Quality
- Self-documenting module names
- JSDoc comments on all functions
- Pure functions without side effects

### 4. Performance
- Zero runtime overhead (direct function calls)
- No additional object creation
- Same execution path as inline code

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Main file continues working unchanged
- All existing tests pass

## What Was NOT Changed

- **Combat target/movement/fire live logic** - Still uses the proven inline runtime implementation
- **Most decision flow** - No broad replacement of combat/profit/safety execution yet
- **API surface** - All exports unchanged
- **Test coverage** - All 310 existing tests pass

## 2026-07-02 Follow-up: Phase 2C Action Arbitration Integration

Commit pending for `bootstrap-0.4.275` changes the first extracted strategy modules from scaffolding into authoritative runtime code:

- `src/strategy/action-priority.js` now matches the previous browser runtime action band and focus summary implementation, including coin/enemy focus keys, safety focus handling, and diagnostic fields.
- `src/strategy/action-arbitration.js` now owns the final-action hold rules used by the browser runtime and Node self-tests: exits are never held, leave/pending-exit actions are not reusable, same-focus actions are not held, profit cannot hold over new combat/safety, and safety cannot block new combat.
- `grasp-rat-bot.js` still emits a single browser script; the strategy functions are inlined into the generated source instead of using browser-side `require()`.
- `src/node/run-self-test.js` calls the strategy arbitration module directly and includes a strategy-suite summary case.
- The generated browser script now defines `OPPORTUNITY_CONSTANTS`, fixing the prior remote-script bug where high-value coin logic referenced that constant without an injected definition.

Combat target selection, movement, and fire-discipline modules remain conservative reference modules until each live replacement is validated with focused replay or self-test evidence.

## 2026-07-02 Follow-up: Phase 2D Target-Switch Diagnostics Integration

`bootstrap-0.4.276` continues the same equivalence-first migration:

- `src/strategy/action-switch-diagnostics.js` now owns target/focus switch event construction, pair-key calculation, reversed-pair oscillation detection, previous-decision score/stamina summaries, and bounded history updates.
- `grasp-rat-bot.js` keeps the browser wrapper `recordActionSwitchDiagnostics()` and still emits a single remote script by inlining the strategy functions.
- `src/strategy/self-test.js` now has 15 tests, including two target-switch diagnostic cases.
- Static verification checks both the strategy source module and generated remote runtime for the target-switch diagnostic core.

This is still a diagnostics-only migration. Combat target selection, movement, and fire-discipline modules remain staged until separately validated.

## 2026-07-02 Follow-up: Phase 2E Coin Diagnostics Integration

`bootstrap-0.4.277` extracts pure coin diagnostics construction:

- `src/strategy/coin-diagnostics.js` now owns coin summary normalization, nearest realtime coin sorting, ignored/snapshot-only near-coin lists, count fields, and filtered-entry de-duplication.
- The browser runtime still owns config/state access, including `cfg` defaults, `bot.ignoredCoins`, stamina affordability checks, and threat-specific diagnostics.
- `src/strategy/self-test.js` now has 17 tests, including two coin diagnostics cases.
- Static verification checks both the strategy source module and generated remote runtime for the coin diagnostics helpers.

This is a diagnostics/data-shaping migration only; it does not change coin selection or movement decisions.

## 2026-07-03 Follow-up: Phase 2F Coin Route Planner Integration

`bootstrap-0.4.278` extracts the coin route planner core while preserving runtime wrappers:

- `src/strategy/coin-route.js` now owns route keys, route id extraction, route leg cost/safety cores, route point limits, route summaries, route point metadata, anchor route construction, closer-first and held-single-coin guards, held route matching, switch hysteresis, and bounded route picking.
- The browser runtime still owns config/state access, including visible coin filtering, stamina affordability checks, threat blocking callbacks, coin filter diagnostics, and current held opportunity choice lookup.
- `src/strategy/self-test.js` now has 20 tests, including three coin route cases covering route metadata, closer-first guarding, and held route stabilization.
- Static verification checks both the strategy source module and generated remote runtime for the coin route core and wrapper.

This is intended as an equivalent extraction of existing route planning logic; ordinary profit arbitration and action construction remain in `grasp-rat-bot.js`.

## 2026-07-03 Follow-up: Phase 2G Opportunity Choice Stability Integration

`bootstrap-0.4.279` extracts opportunity choice matching and stability core logic:

- `src/strategy/opportunity-choice.js` now owns opportunity key parsing, previous-choice parsing, same-coin coordinate matching, high-value coin hold checks, switch-margin hold rules, locked-opportunity recovery, and oscillation lock state transitions.
- The browser runtime still owns `bot.opportunityChoice`, `bot.opportunitySwitchLock`, config access, and action construction; wrappers pass runtime state into the strategy core and write the returned switch-lock state back to `bot`.
- `src/strategy/self-test.js` now has 25 tests, including five opportunity choice cases covering key parsing, coordinate matching, margin holds, high-value coin enemy-switch blocking, and oscillation locking.
- Static verification checks both the strategy source module and generated remote runtime for the opportunity choice core and wrapper.

This is intended as an equivalent extraction of the stable-choice layer only; opportunity candidate construction and missing-held cleanup remain in `grasp-rat-bot.js`.

## Next Steps (Not Implemented Yet)

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Action arbitration and focus summary: integrated in `bootstrap-0.4.275`
2. Target-switch diagnostics: integrated in `bootstrap-0.4.276`
3. Coin diagnostics construction: integrated in `bootstrap-0.4.277`
4. Coin route planner core: integrated in `bootstrap-0.4.278`
5. Opportunity choice stability: integrated in `bootstrap-0.4.279`
6. Constants: partially integrated for high-value coin defaults
7. Combat/profit/safety helpers: integrate only in small, replay-validated slices
8. Run live validation sessions after each behavior-touching replacement

### Phase 3: Further Extraction
1. Profit/opportunity selection module
2. Safety/avoidance module
3. Movement execution module
4. State management utilities

### Phase 4: Optimization
1. Performance profiling
2. Memory usage analysis
3. Decision tree visualization
4. Hot path optimization

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk** - This phase only adds new files, doesn't modify existing logic:
- Main file unchanged
- All tests passing
- No behavior changes
- Easy rollback (just don't import modules)

**Future Integration Risk** - Phase 2 will be moderate risk:
- Will modify main decision loop
- Requires offline replay validation
- Must verify no behavior regression
- Should be done incrementally with testing at each step

## Conclusion

Successfully extracted core strategy logic into 8 modular, testable components totaling 1,686 lines of well-documented code. All validation passes. The codebase is now better organized and more maintainable, with clear pathways for future improvements.

The main bot remains fully functional. Action arbitration is now integrated through the strategy modules; the remaining modules are ready for gradual, evidence-backed integration when needed.
